# Welcome to the JCRS Repository!

Maybe you're wondering, what the hell is 'JCRS'???

JCRS stands for Just Create Random Stuff.

Okay, with that out of the way, WHY???

Because you'll never improve if you don't produce code.

Rather than spending all your time going through tutorials...

Or waiting for ChatGPT to generate the code...

You must do:

1. Small...
2. Fast...
3. Bad...
4. Stupid...
5. Pointless...

...Code.

Again, why???

Here's why:

### Small
- Small enough to be done within a weekend

### Fast
- Something you are able to do quickly

### Bad
- To avoid resistance and fear of starting

### Stupid
- To get rid of the fear of other's opinion

### Pointless
- To remove the pressure of the outcome

---

So, are you ready to create random stuff?

This is the sign that you're waiting for :>

Open your IDE and start typing!
